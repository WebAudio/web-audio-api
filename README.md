This repository contains the latest editor's draft of the [W3C AudioWG](https://www.w3.org/2011/audio/)'s Web Audio API v1.0.

You can preview the current version of the `main` branch [here](https://webaudio.github.com/web-audio-api/).

# Tests

For normative changes, a corresponding
[web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR is highly appreciated. Typically,
both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should
not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why
and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new) to follow
up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.

We also have an [implementation report](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/implementation-report.html).

# v2.0

See [Web Audio API v.2.0](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api-v2) .
